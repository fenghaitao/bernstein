"""Structural assertions on the SonarQube scan workflow.

These tests pin the contract that the Sonar scan consumes the coverage
artifact from a successful CI run for the same main commit. The scan
must not start on the raw push event or on a cancelled CI run before the
matching CI coverage artifact exists.

The tests below assert the workflow has:

    * a ``workflow_run`` trigger for completed main CI runs,
    * a job guard that accepts only successful main CI workflow runs,
    * no direct ``push`` trigger, because that races the CI artifact,
    * a workflow-run artifact download keyed to the triggering CI run,
    * a thin fallback limited to manual dispatch only.

The tests are cheap; they parse YAML only and do not call the GitHub
API.
